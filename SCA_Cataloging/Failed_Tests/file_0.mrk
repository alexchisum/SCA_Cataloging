=520  \\$a"This book explores the way in which new states emerge in the modern international system. While the subject of secession and state creation has rarely been so newsworthy - especially in light of the 2022 war in Ukraine and other conflicts in the international system - recent events in places such as Kosovo, Catalonia and Kurdistan have highlighted just how difficult it is to create a new country in the modern international system. Although there are now 193 members of the United Nations, just ten states have joined the organisation in the past quarter century. This leads to the obvious question: why is it so hard for territories to gain independence? Using a concise question and answer format, this book explains the evolution of international thinking on secession and state creation and clearly explains the key concepts underpinning the political and legal debates on statehood. To illustrate the points, it draws on many of the most important independence movements over the past two hundred years. It then considers the key attributes of statehood. For example, what institutions does a state need? Does it have to have its own currency and armed forces? It also explains how a new state becomes a part of the wider international system. Finally, it considers whether the international community will rethink its long-standing opposition to secession and open the way for a new era of state creation"--$cProvided by publisher.

Focusing on the production and reception of these texts, the book explains the relevance of publishing to the cultural, commercial and social contexts of collections and their institutions.0Combining theory with case studies from around the world, Sarah Anne Hughes explores how, why and to what effect museums and galleries publish books. Covering a broad range of publishing formats and organisations, including heritage sites, libraries and temporary exhibitions, the book argues that the production and consumption of printed media within the context of collecting institutions occupies a unique and privileged role in the creation and communication of knowledge. Acknowledging that books offer functions beyond communication, Hughes argues that this places books published by museums in a unique relationship to institutions, with staff acting as producers and visitors as consumers.The logistical and ethical dimensions of museum and gallery publishing are also examined in depth, including consideration of issues such as production, the impact of digital technologies, funding and sponsorship, marketing, co-publishing, rights, and curators' and artists' agency.0Focusing on an important but hitherto neglected topic, 'Museum and Gallery Publishing' is key reading for researchers in the fields of museum, heritage, art and publishing studies. It will also be of interest to curators and other practitioners working in museums, heritage and science centres and art galleries.

=520  \\$aThis anthology by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Thornton Wilder is a collection of 22 very short plays, three of which are published here for the very first time. These snapshots of the creative spirit at play explore a variety of complex characters that range from the ordinary to the biblical, the haunted to the mystical. From the tale of a conflicted composer with a strangely familiar tune stuck in his head (The Song of Maria Bentedos) to a pair of newlyweds who find themselves bizarrely affected by the color of their hotel's tea room (Flamingo Red: A Comedy in Danger), all these tales--many told with great wit and humor--ask the thought-provoking questions of mortality, morality and faith that Thornton Wilder is famous for asking. Most of the plays run about four minutes in length, and can be presented with three actors. The entire collection can be presented with a cast ranging from six to 32 actors.

It highlights substantial discrepancies in their media portrayals, essentially motivated by partisanship, journalistic norms, candidate-related attributes, and the unfolding global changes. It offers new theoretical and practical insights into research on political communication research, corpus linguistics, systemic functional linguistics, critical discourse analysis, and pragmatics."--Cover page 4.

=520  \\$a"Although police behavior and the cost of housing are debated nationally, much of the policymaking on these issues takes place, not at the national level, but in local governments. The role of the federal government in managing the thousands of local police departments is very limited. On housing, the absence of affordable housing is largely the result of zoning laws and development decisions made at the local level. In Local Interests: Interest Groups and Public Policy in U.S. City Government, Sarah Anzia explores local governments and the interest groups that lobby them on important issues, with a focus on police and economic development and housing, areas that are critical in local politics. In doing so, Anzia not only offers a different perspective on these critical issues, for example demonstrating why reforms in policing practices supported by progressive often are stymied, and why efforts to increase density and create more houses fail. Anzia also contributes to our knowledge about how interest groups function generally and giving us an important perspective on the too-often stepchild of political science, local politics"--$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$a"Successful costume design requires a solid foundation in general artistic principles and specific knowledge of how to apply those principles. Cunningham presents readers with just such a foundation and develops it to expose beginning costume designers to the myriad skills they need to develop in order to costume successful stage productions. She begins at the most basic conceptual level reading plays from a costume designer's perspective. She then follows through with the practical considerations that must be considered at every stage of the costuming process research, development, sketching, and costume construction. Cunningham has built on the long-standing success of the outstanding first edition with new figures and updates throughout the text, including 24 pages in full color. Examples have been selected from a wide range of stage productions representing a variety of designers, styles, and approaches. Interviews with award-winning designers from stage, film, and other media show the practical importance of the book's concepts. Every chapter incorporates material reflecting the ever-increasing impact of technology, especially computers, on costuming. New to this edition is an ancillary download package, giving students a selection of basic figure drawings to serve as the base layer for digital renderings, ready-made forms and checklists for assembling and organizing costumes for shows, and a list of research and reference websites with easily clickable links." -- Amazon

Along the way, it gives the reader a behind-the-scenes look at pitfalls and successes, and it provides firsthand knowledge from different production collaborators"--$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$a"Richly illustrated with images from Art Spiegelman's work, Maus Now gathers together many of contemporary culture's leading critics, authors, and academics on the radical achievement and innovation of Maus more than forty years since its first publication. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Art Spiegelman is one of our most influential contemporary artists, and it is hard to overstate his effect on postwar American culture. Maus has shaped the fields of literature, history, and art, and enlivened our collective sense of what these practices can accomplish. Maus Now: Selected Writing collects responses to the work that confirm its unique and terrain-shifting status. Here, writers such as Philip Pullman, Robert Storr, Ruth Franklin, and others approach Maus from a wide range of viewpoints and traditions, inspired by the material's complexity. The book is organized into three very loosely chronological sections: "Contexts," "Problems of Representation," and "Legacy," and offers translations of important French, Hebrew, and German essays on Maus for the first time. Maus is revelatory, and generative, in profound and long-lasting ways. With this collection, American literary scholar (and expert on comics and graphic narratives) Hillary Chute assembles the best work around the globe exploring this classic graphic biography"--$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$aThis interdisciplinary collection explores four distinct perspectives about the mask, as object of use for protection, identity, and disguise. In part I, contributors address human identities within collective social performance, with chapters on performativity and the far right and masked identities in political resistance and communication. Part II focuses on the mask as a signifying object with strong representational challenges, exploring representations in festivals, literature, and film. Part III investigates the ambiguous use of the mask as a protective and concealing element, delving into visual culture and digital social media contexts. Finally, Part VI draws on the work of Levinas and Deleuze to investigate a philosophical view of the mask that addresses memory and ethics within intersubjective relationships. Questioning the contemporary world, using communication, sociology, visual culture, and philosophical theory, the volume provides a pedagogical and formative perspective on the mask. Luisa Magalhaes is Assistant Professor at the Catholic University of Portugal, and editor of 'Toys and Communication' (2018). Candido Oliveira Martins is Associate Professor at the Catholic University of Portugal.

Eminent French literature professor R. Howard Bloch has become renowned for his insider tours of Paris, given to college students abroad. Long sought after for his encyclopedic knowledge of French cathedrals, Bloch has at last decided to share his intimate knowledge with a wider audience. Here, six cathedrals-Saint-Denis, Chartres, Sainte-Chapelle, Reims, Amiens, and Notre-Dame-are illumined in magnificent detail as Bloch, taking us from the High Middle Ages to the devastating fire that set Notre-Dame ablaze in 2019, traces the evolution of each in turn. Contextualizing the cathedrals within the annals of French history, Bloch animates the past with lush evocations of architectural splendor-high-flying buttresses and jewel-encrusted shrines, hidden burial grounds and secret chambers-and thrilling tales of kingly intrigue, audacious architects, and the meeting of aristocratic and everyday life. Complete with the author's own photographs, Paris and Her Cathedrals vitally enhances our understanding of the history of Paris and its environs"--$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$a"An incisive exploration of ballet's role in the modern world, told through the experience of the author and her classmates at the most elite ballet school in the country: the School of American Ballet. Ballet is an art full of hyper-feminine trappings, but beneath the ornate costumes and exaggerated stage makeup, traits like thinness, stoicism, and submission are valued above all else. Journalist Alice Robb spent years immersed in that universe as a child, but as an adult, she couldn't shake the feeling that the same laws that governed the dance world still applied in the regular one. Certain bodies hold more value than others, and men oftentimes hold the most power of all. Pain is best left concealed, along with sexuality, in all of its messiness. Obedience and conformity are rewarded, while standing out comes at a cost. Profound, nuanced, and obsessively researched, Don't Think, Dear, is Robb's excavation of her adolescent years as a dancer, and an exploration of how those days informed her life for years to come. As she grapples with the pressure she faced as a student at the storied School of American Ballet, she explores the fates of her former classmates as well. From sweet and shy Emily--whose body was deemed "thin enough" only when she was too ill to eat--to the precocious and talented Meiying--who despite her success, had to contend with the fact that she was the only Vietnamese-American in the school. Altogether, their stories are ones of heartbreak and resilience, of reinvention and regret. Along the way, Robb weaves in the myths of famous ballerinas past and present, from the groundbreaking Misty Copeland, to the controversial George Balanchine. Ballet does not exist in a vacuum, it is a laboratory of womanhood, a test-tube world in which traditional femininity is exaggerated. By exploring the psyche of a dancer, Don't Think, Dear grapples with the contradictions and challenges of being a woman today. It's also a story about chasing your dreams, however complicated, and learning when to let them go"--$cProvided by publisher.

As she interacts with the other waiting passengers, Dana begins to learn that if she wants to get where she's going, she'll have to figure out who she really is.

When a destructive new reality hits close to home, Luis is forced to ask whether politics have a place on the field, and if he is willing to risk his career to take a stand for his own community.--$cProvided by publisher.

The winner rules the capital city and all the people who labor for it, while the loser remains trapped forever in the underworld. Cricket has trained for his entire life with his twin sister, Moth, and he is favored to be the first of their tribe to win the Blood Race. When Cricket fails, the high priestess, Iguana, challenges Moth to compete in the next race against King Jaguar. Moth's strategies are unusual, baffling even Aquili, her spirit guide in the underworld. When Moth learns the truth of the Blood Race, she is faced with a choice that could turn the world upside down. An invented mythology inspired by classic Mayan narratives, The Hero Twins: Blood Race is an action-filled adventure that is also an allegory about inequality, justice and liberation.

=520  \\$a"Catastrophic climate change overshadows the present and the future. Wrenching economic transformations have devastated workers and hollowed out communities. However, those fighting for jobs and those fighting for the planet have often been at odds. Does the world face two separate crises, environmental and economic? The promise of the Green New Deal is to tackle the threat of climate change through the empowerment of working people and the strengthening of democracy. In this view, the crisis of nature and the crisis of work must be addressed together-or they will not be addressed at all. This book brings together leading experts to explore the possibilities of the Green New Deal, emphasizing the future of work. Together, they examine transformations that are already underway and put forth bold new proposals that can provide jobs while reducing carbon consumption-building a world that is sustainable both economically and ecologically. Contributors also debate urgent questions: What is the value of a federal jobs program, or even a jobs guarantee? How do we alleviate the miseries and precarity of work? In key economic sectors, including energy, transportation, housing, agriculture, and care work, what kind of work is needed today? How does the New Deal provide guidance in addressing these questions, and how can a Green New Deal revive democracy? Above all, this book shows, the Green New Deal offers hope for a better tomorrow-but only if it accounts for work's past transformations and shapes its future"--$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$a"Obeah, Orisa, and Religious Identity in Trinidad is an expansive two-volume examination of social imaginaries concerning Obeah and Yoruba-Orisa from colonialism to the present. Analyzing their entangled histories and systems of devotion, Tracey E. Hucks and Dianne M. Stewart articulate how these religions were criminalized during slavery and colonialism yet still demonstrated autonomous modes of expression and self-defense. In Volume I, Obeah, Hucks traces the history of African religious repression in colonial Trinidad through the late nineteenth century. Drawing on sources ranging from colonial records, laws, and legal transcripts to travel diaries, literary fiction, and written correspondence, she documents the persecution and violent penalization of African religious practices encoded under the legal classification of "Obeah." A cult of antiblack fixation emerged as white settlers defined themselves in opposition to Obeah, which they imagined as terrifying African witchcraft. These preoccupations revealed the fears that bound whites to one another. At the same time, persons accused of obeah sought legal vindication and marshaled their own spiritual and medicinal technologies to fortify the cultural heritages, religious identities, and life systems of African-diasporic communities in Trinidad"--$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$a"The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Political Science contains twenty-seven freshly written chapters to give the reader a panoramic introduction to philosophical issues in the practice of political science. Simultaneously, it advances the field of Philosophy of Political Science by creating a fruitful meeting place where both philosophers and practicing political scientists contribute and discuss. These philosophical discussions are close to and informed by actual developments in political science, making philosophy of science continuous with the sciences, another aspiration that motivates this volume. The chapters fall under four headings: (1) evaluating theoretical frameworks in political science; (2) methodological challenges and reconciliations; (3) the purposes and uses of political science; and, (4) the interactions between political science and society. Specific topics discussed include the biology of political attitudes, intra-agent mechanisms, rational choice explanations, theories of collective action, explaining institutional change, conceptualizing and measuring democracy, process tracing, qualitative comparative analysis, interpretivism and positivism, mixed methods, within-cause causal inference, evidential pluralism, lab and field experiments, external validity, contextualization, prediction, expertise, clientelism, feminism, values, and progress in political science"--$cProvided by publisher.

This new text guides beginning directors, designers, and performers through the many interwoven relationships and communication styles used during this journey and details the context, vision, parameters, materials, aesthetics, documentation, and facilitation of the design and production process. Drawing from over thirty years as a theatre educator and costume designer, Ryerson uses examples from actual productions to provide valuable insight into creating visually symbolic storytelling. Specific areas covered include the historical development of performance; navigating the relationship between artistic and business factions; job descriptions and hierarchies; design elements and principles; set components and construction; the design and production of costumes, lighting, and sound; special effects; and how everything comes together. Including 16 pages of full-color photos, this universal and practical approach benefits all members of this unique art form" --Provided by publisher.

=520  \\$aThis volume explores the labyrinth of what we call Coleridge (Virginia Woolf): his poems and prose, their sources, interpretation and reception; his life, troubled marriage and fatherhood, conversation, changing intellectual contexts and legacy. Major entries cover such canonical works as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, Kubla Khan, the conversation poems and Biographia Literaria. But a fuller understanding of Coleridge must embrace many lesser-known poems lyrics, satire, comical squibs. The prose critical, philosophical, political, religious ranges from his early radical writings to the more conservative On the Constitution of the Church and State, his influential Shakespeare lectures, and the vast resource of the notebooks. Coleridge read widely throughout his life and engaged extensively with the work of, among many others, Milton, Fielding, Berkeley, Priestley, Kant, Schelling. One of his most important relationships was with William Wordsworth. Another was with Sara Hutchinson. Entries trace Coleridges changing reputation, from brilliant young activist to the Sage of Highgate to the later apostle of the theories of the imagination and of Practical Criticism. Other topics covered include opium, plagiarism, the French Revolution, Pantisocracy, Unitarianism, and the Salutation and Cat tavern.

When she is hired at Berry's, a store off the interstate selling everything from baby carrots to lawnmowers, she begins to understand a new kind of isolation. Paris is a play about invisibility, being underpaid, and how it feels to work on your feet for ten hours a day. --$cProvided by publisher.

=520  \\$aThis collection of seven darkly funny and mysterious plays includes the long one act Pirandello, in which the great Italian playwright, writing alone on the stage of his theatre late at night, is interrupted by the Italian dictator Mussolini, who wants him to write the authorized biographical play of the dictator's life, Pirandello's jealous wife, who believes Pirandello is sleeping with every woman in sight, including his daughter, and an increasingly disturbing group of characters who may or may not be real, leading Pirandello to question the relationship between his theories about the malleable nature of reality to the rise of Fascism and Fascist propaganda; The Recollection Of Green Rain, which tells the mostly true story of two green children found wandering near an English village, who spoke an unknown language and insisted they were from a mysterious green underground kingdom; Pinocchio, in which Gloria's blind date turns out to be an angry puppet with a rather unsettling story to tell; Rusalka, in which a police officer investigating the disappearance of a young girl tries to make sense out of the increasingly odd stories her best friend tells about her; Humpty Dumpty, in which an enormous egg with very bad hair sits on top of a wall and talks about making Wonderland great again; Brimstone Run, in which a family legacy of betrayal and tragedy is played out at the town dump; and Nictzin Dyalhis, in which a legendary, reclusive writer of weird tales is haunted by a sea goddess he may or may not have invented. In each of these plays, in one way or another, compelling characters find themselves lost in a labyrinthine twilight zone of dream variations which combine the Gothic, the surreal and the absurd.--$cPublisher.

Which is more important--justice or mercy? Does the end ever justify the means? How can we move beyond racial stereotypes? Whose life is worth living and who gets to decide that? What would you sacrifice to save the earth? These are some of the questions posed by this collection, whose characters--parents and children, friends and lovers, colleagues and classmates, constant comrades and scary strangers--grapple with injustice, love, political passion, fear of dying and the curse of conscience.

Based on the 2017 hit film of the same name, A Very Sordid Wedding explores the questions, bigotry and the fallout of what happens when gay marriage comes to communities and families that are not quite ready to accept it. Bigoted "religious freedom," marriage equality and cultural acceptance are all explored with Del Shores' trademark approach to using comedy and his much-beloved Sordid Lives characters to deal with these important current social issues and the very real process of accepting your family for who they are instead of who you want them to be.--$cProvided by publisher.

How should the party relate to the ex-president and his supporters? Have the events of early 2021 done lasting damage? What, if anything, of the Trump legacy is worth retaining? What should the Republican Party do to regain their congressional majorities and position themselves to win the presidency in 2024? The Elephant in the Room brings together a distinguished group of right-leaning pundits and political scientists, from ardent supporters of Trump and Trumpism to prominent leaders of the never Trump movement.

Written by eminent international scholars, it spans the full range of dance-theatre genres over the past fifteen hundred years, including noh theatre, bunraku puppet theatre, kabuki theatre, shingeki modern theatre, rakugo storytelling, vanguard butoh dance, and media experimentation. The first part addresses traditional genres, their historical trajectories, and performance conventions. Part II covers the spectrum of new genres since Meiji (1868- ), and Parts III to VI provide discussions of playwriting, architecture, Shakespeare, and interculturalism, situating Japanese elements within their global theatrical context. Beautifully illustrated with photographs and prints, this history features interviews with key modern directors, an overview of historical scholarship in English and Japanese, and a timeline."--Page 4 of cover

=520  8\$aOn March 13, 2020 when the global coronavirus pandemic brought life as we know it to an abrupt halt, the International Center of Photography, just weeks after opening in a brand-new building on Manhattan'ss Lower East Side that was buzzing with visitors, was forced to close its doors. Wanting to do more than virtual exhibition tours, ICP announced the #ICPConcerned open call on March 20th, an invitation for people to make, upload, and tag images on Instagram of whatever was going on in their lives wherever they were. What resulted was more than sixty thousand submissions from countries as far flung as France, Singapore, Argentina, Nigeria, Canada, and Iran. From the halls of medical facilities to eerily empty streets and domestic settings converted into home offices and classrooms, the more than 800 photographs collected here are organized chronologically and accompanied by headlines gathered from various global news entities. Taken together, these words and pictures represent the pain, heartbreak, hope, and occasional humor we've all experienced this past year against the backdrop of COVID-19, unrelenting racial injustice, and a divisive political climate. Exhibition: ICP International Center for Photography, New York, USA (01.10.2020 - 03.01.2021).
